# Data standard reference

Data standard documents provide [a guide to the standard itself]({{ site.baseurl }}/Guidance/) and to how it can be applied for describing services and interchanging service information in the UK.

Some documents are at draft status and will change as the standard matures.

You can submit proposed changes to documents [here via Github](https://github.com/OpenReferralUK/human-services/tree/gh-pages) pages and to the standard itself [here in Github](https://github.com/OpenReferralUK/human-services/).
