# Open Referral UK Data Standard
These pages provide guidance on using the Open Referral UK standard - a UK extension to the international [Open Referral](https://openreferral.org/) standard for interchange of data on human services.

They describe the standard data structure and Application Programmer Interface (API). They also link to provide open source tools to help adopt the standard and see what others are doing with it.

Check the [Contact us](/ContactUs/) page if you need help applying the standard or want to publicise how you use it.
